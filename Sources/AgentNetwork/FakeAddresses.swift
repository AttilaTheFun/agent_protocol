// The addresses agent-network's resolver gives out (docs/retiring-multipass.md,

// one of 198.18.0.0/15 (RFC 2544's, never a real host's), and a connection
// to it is sent on as `CONNECT name:port`, so the name, not an address,
// goes to agent-proxy. The first, 198.18.0.1, is given to no name: it is the
// container's own, the source of every connection (ContainerNetwork).
